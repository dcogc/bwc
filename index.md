The D.C. Open Government Coalition (DCOGC) released today a comprehensive look at how each of the fifteen states and fifteen of the largest cities are legislating on key issues surrounding the implementation of police body cameras.   A response to  demands from  individuals and organizations around the country for increased transparency and accountability surrounding police interactions  with citizens, body worn cameras present difficult policy decisions in terms of their use, the maintenance of any recordings and ability of the public to access recorded content.   The DCOGC believes this is the first time anyone has compiled the vast panoply of legislation on body cameras into a single, easily accessible and reviewable document.

“As we were preparing  testimony for a hearing of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Council of the District of Columbia, we realized that we might benefit to see how other states and large cities had approached the issue and whether any trends or even best practices were emerging,” said DCOGC President Kevin M. Goldberg.  “We asked our pro bono legal counsel at Ropes & Gray LLP if they could research this among the states.  Their research was so incredibly comprehensive and informative that we simply had to share it with others working on this issue.  We can’t thank our attorneys enough and are very proud to be able to make this available.”

The research as initially presented looks at how these states and cities mandate when recordings must be made (and similarly when recording cannot occur) during police-citizen interactions, how long a video must be maintained after it was recorded, the treatment of these videos under relevant state or local freedom of information, public records or right to know laws and, for comparison purposes, how these jurisdictions have treated police dashcam videos under public records laws.

The initial research can be found on the [DCOGC’s website](http://dcogc.org). The information is presented in a Github format with an invitation to the public to edit information as new developments occur.  There is also an [Executive Summary](executive-summary) (also prepared by attorneys at Ropes & Gray LLP) which gives an overview of the findings and the ability to review the [original results]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/body_camera_research.pdf) of this research project (more than 115 pages in length), which will remain static and current as of June 12, 2015.

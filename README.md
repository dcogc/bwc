# Body Worn Cameras

The DCOGC prepared a survey of all laws or pending legislation specifically dealing with body worn cameras, and how those laws or bills deal with the subjects of:

1. when cameras must be turned on and when they absolutely should remain off while a police officer is on duty;
2. how long a video must be retained after it is recorded; and
3. how the recorded video is treated for purposes for the relevant public records laws.

For comparison purposes the survey also notes how the jurisdiction treats police dashcam videos for purposes of the public records law.
